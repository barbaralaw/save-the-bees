          <h1>Let's Save the Bees!</h1>

          

          <p>
            Hey there, welcome! My name is Archer, and I'm on a mission to save
            the incredible, helpful, buzzy bees! Some people may be scared of them - they sometimes have a reputation for being scary, but
            they're HUGE heroes for our planet, making our food grow and keeping
            the air clean.
          </p>
          <p> Sadly, they're in trouble, and we should help them!</p>

          <h2>What's the buzz about?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Did you know that bees have been disappearing?</b> It's true! By some estimates, 9 out of every 10 bees in some areas have completely disappeared in the last 10 years. It's called Bee Colony Collapse and has a lot of scientists worried.</li>
            <li><b>Guess how many plants bees pollinate!</b> Bees pollinate 80% of all flowering plants throughout the world, including many kinds of fruits and vegetables. Plants have to be pollinated in order to keep growing, and without bees not enough will grow.</li>
            <li><b>There are so many kinds of bees!</b> Big fuzzy honey bees might be the first thing people think of, but there are actually over 20,000 species of bees in the world. In California there are over 1600 kinds bees that are native to the area!</li>
            <li><b>Aren't bees mean and sting people?</b> If you believe this, you're not alone, but it's not true! Bees generally only sting as an final form of self-defense. If we don't bother them, they aren't bothered with us.</li>
            <li><b>How can I help?</b> We can all help a little bit at a time. Plant flowering plants, even better if they're native to your area and pollinator friendly! Don't swat at bees when you see them. Spread the word about what amazing bugs they are so others start to help too!</li>
          </ul>

// Buzzing with Love for Bees! Hi everyone! My name is [Child's Name], and
//         I'm here to talk about my favorite fuzzy friends: bees! They might look
//         small, but they're HUGE helpers for our planet. Why should we save the
//         bees? They make yummy food: Imagine no fruits, vegetables, or even
//         chocolate! Bees help plants grow by giving them a special hug called
//         pollination. They keep our air clean: Just like us, bees need fresh air
//         to breathe. By planting flowers, we can create healthy homes for them!
//         They're super cool: Did you know some bees can dance to tell their
//         friends where to find yummy food? But bees are in trouble! Sadly, their
//         homes are disappearing, and they're getting sick from chemicals. How can
//         we help bees in Southern California? Plant a bee garden: Even a small
//         pot with colorful flowers can be a bee haven! Ask your grown-up for help
//         choosing bee-friendly plants. Skip the pesticides: Yucky chemicals hurt
//         bees and other helpful creatures. Let's keep our gardens natural! Bee a
//         bee detective: Learn about different bee types and tell your friends so
//         they can help too! Spread the buzz: Share your love for bees with
//         everyone you know! This website is my little corner to share bee fun
//         facts, cool projects, and ways we can all help. Let's work together to
//         make sure bees buzz happily for years to come! Bonus: Check out these
//         cool bee websites and games! [Link to website 1] [Link to website 2]
//         [Link to bee game] Remember, even small actions can make a big
//         difference! Together, we can bee the change! P.S. If you see a lost bee,
//         gently put it on a flower. They'll be super grateful!
